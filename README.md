# OverLook 

## Abstract
Overlook was my final project for Turingâ€™s Mod 2. The goal was to create an Hotel in which both customers and a manager could both access. When I customer looks in they were to be met with information about their present and past bookings as well as the total the spent on bookings in total. In addition, the user is able to filter through rooms based off of availability from the date they selected and the further from room type. As a manager, they would be shown a different portal that would first show them the rooms booked, percentage of rooms available and finally the total revenue from the day. They should also see each user and be able to filter through them by name. They were also suppose to see each customers bookings and add or delete a booking for a user. I unfortunately, I was not able to get through this portion of the project given the allotted time.
